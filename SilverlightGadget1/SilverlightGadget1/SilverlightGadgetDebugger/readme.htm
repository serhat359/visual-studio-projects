        <title>Silverlight Gadget Template Useful Information</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of the SilverlightGadgetDebugger project is only to act as a debug session starter for the
            Silverlight gadget. Even though it is a console application project, it produces no output.
            Instead, whenever the project is started it will invoke the SidebarSandboxStarter.exe file.
            This application receives the current solution path as a command line parameter. 
            It uses this information to connect to the Visual Studio that has the specified solution opened.
            The SidebarSandboxStarter will attach the debugger from that instance of Visual Studio to the Windows Sidebar
            process (sidebar.exe). If the process is not started, it will start it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Silverlight gadgets that use a Sivlerlight version older than 5.0 only work in the 32 bit version
             of the Sidebar. Template will attach to the 32 bit or 64 bit version of the Sidebar, depending on the value of
             Platform Target setting of the SilverlightGadgetDebugger project (from the property pages of the project).
             <ul>
                 <li>AnyCPU : 32 bit Sidebar</li>
                 <li>x86    : 32 bit Sidebar</li>
                 <li>x64    : 64 bit Sidebar (only on 64 bit OS, otherwise, 32 bit)</li>
                 <li>Itanium: 64 bit Sidebar (only on 64 bit OS, otherwise, 32 bit)</li>
             </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Adding More Content to the SilverlightGadgetWeb Project</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Include the content in the project</li>
            <li>Set the "Build Action" to "Content"</li>
            <li>Set the "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy always" or "Copy if newer"</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>How to Debug Silverlight Gadgets Built Using This Template</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Make sure that the SilverlightGadgetDebugger is set as the startup project in the solution.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure that the proper Platform Target is set for the SilverlightGadgetDebugger project.
                For Silverlight versions older than 5.0, only AnyCPU or x86 will work.</li>
            <li>
                Start debugging this project (F5) and eventually Visual Studio will automatically attach to the Sidebar.
                At this point you can debug.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you stop debugging the project, the Sidebar is restored to the previous state.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you run or debug using the method described in this file, you will get a UI with a "Close"
                button that you can use to terminate the run or debug session.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sometimes it can take a bit longer (though not more than aprox. 20 seconds) for Visual Studio to attach to
            the Sidebar. If you feel that the debugger is taking too long to attach, kill the SidebarSandboxStarter.exe
            process and try again.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you start the SilverlightGadgetDebugger project without debugging (Ctrl+ F5), it is possible that you
            will get a console window that will eventually prompt you to "Press any key to continue...".
            You can close this window and there won't be any side-effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an alternative, you can manually attach to the 32 bit Sidebar process (without involving the
            SilverlightGadgetDebugger project at all).
        </p>
        <h1>How to Publish Silverlight Gadgets Built Using This Template</h1>
        <p>
            Each time the SilverlightGadgetWeb project is built, a corresponding .gadget deployment file is generated.
            The file is located under SilverlightGadgetWeb\bin\Publish.
        </p>
        <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
        <p>
            Please don't move or change the name of the SilverlightGadgetDebugger project, as the build events from the
            template rely on the project's name (and relative path within the solution).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you make changes to some of the template generated files that break the build of the .gadget file or
            the F5 debugging experience, you can create a new project using the template and compare your changes with the
            original working versions.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you change the Platform Target, unload/reload or close/open the SilverlightGadgetDebugger project.
            Otherwise, the change will not be picked up by the starting arguments of the project
            (limitation in Visual Studio).
        </p>
